IDLE (Integrated Development and Learning Environment)
    It’s a Python shell where you can type short scripts and see their output immediately and even interact with code in real time.

    Type idle into terminal and it will open up a Python shell.

In the File menu, you’ll find a Path Browser which is useful for figuring out where Python looks for module imports.
Next there’s a Class Browser that will help you navigate your code.

IDLE is neat, but I will probably do most of my work in Visual Studio Code.
